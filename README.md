# Wireguard-Keys
Generate a lot of wireguard keys very fast using a web interface.

## Project goals

1. Generate a lot of wireguard keys for generating wireguard configuration files.
2. Make it usable to use user.  That is why I programmed a JSON interface, and a CSV.
3. And forget that the keys ever existed.  Removed logging

## Disclaimers

Still a work in progress, may need a lot of TLC.

### My Background

I am more of a programmer that moves data around, a lot of it.  My front-end design skills have a lot to be desired, but if you want to touch up the UX, you are more than welcome to.
