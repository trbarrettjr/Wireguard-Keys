              NAME
                     wg-quick - set up a WireGuard interface simply
              
              SYNOPSIS
                     wg-quick [ up | down | save | strip ] [ CONFIG_FILE | INTERFACE ]
              
              DESCRIPTION
                     This is an extremely simple script for easily bringing up a WireGuard interface, suitable for a few common use cases.
              
                     Use up to add and set up an interface, and use down to tear down and remove an interface. Running up adds a WireGuard in‐
                     terface, brings up the interface with the supplied IP addresses, sets up mtu and routes, and optionally runs pre/post  up
                     scripts.	 Running  down	optionally saves the current configuration, removes the WireGuard interface, and optionally runs
                     pre/post down scripts. Running save saves the configuration of an existing interface without bringing the interface down.
                     Use strip to output a configuration file with all wg-quick(8)-specific options removed, suitable for use with wg(8).
              
                     CONFIG_FILE is a configuration file, whose filename is the interface name followed by `.conf'. Otherwise, INTERFACE is an
                     interface name, with configuration found at `/etc/wireguard/INTERFACE.conf', searched first, followed by	 distro-specific
                     search paths.
              
                     Generally  speaking,  this utility is just a simple script that wraps invocations to wg(8) and ip(8) in order to set up a
                     WireGuard interface. It is designed for users with simple needs, and users with more advanced needs are highly encouraged
                     to use a more specific tool, a more complete network manager, or otherwise just use wg(8) and ip(8), as usual.
              
              CONFIGURATION
                     The  configuration file adds a few extra configuration values to the format understood by wg(8) in order to configure ad‐
                     ditional attributes of an interface. It handles the values that it understands, and then it passes the remaining ones di‐
                     rectly to wg(8) for further processing.
              
                     It infers all routes from the list of peers' allowed IPs, and automatically adds them to the system routing table. If one
                     of those routes is the default route (0.0.0.0/0 or ::/0), then it uses ip-rule(8) to handle  overriding	of  the	 default
                     gateway.
              
                     The  configuration file will be passed directly to wg(8)'s `setconf' sub-command, with the exception of the following ad‐
                     ditions to the Interface section, which are handled by this tool:
              
                     •      Address — a comma-separated list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses (optionally with CIDR masks) to be assigned to the in‐
                           terface. May be specified multiple times.
              
                     •      DNS  — a comma-separated list of IP (v4 or v6) addresses to be set as the interface's DNS servers, or non-IP host‐
                           names to be set as the interface's DNS search domains. May be specified multiple times. Upon bringing  the  inter‐
                           face  up,	 this  runs  `resolvconf  -a  tun.INTERFACE -m 0 -x` and upon bringing it down, this runs `resolvconf -d
                           tun.INTERFACE`. If these particular invocations of resolvconf(8) are undesirable, the PostUp and PostDown keys be‐
                           low may be used instead.
              
                     •      MTU  —  if  not  specified,  the MTU is automatically determined from the endpoint addresses or the system default
                           route, which is usually a sane choice. However, to manually specify an MTU to override this  automatic  discovery,
                           this value may be specified explicitly.
              
                     •      Table  —	Controls  the  routing table to which routes are added. There are two special values: `off' disables the
                           creation of routes altogether, and `auto' (the default) adds routes to the default table and enables special  han‐
                           dling of default routes.
              
                     •      PreUp, PostUp, PreDown, PostDown — script snippets which will be executed by bash(1) before/after setting up/tear‐
                           ing down the interface, most commonly used to configure custom DNS options or firewall rules. The	 special  string
                           `%i'  is	expanded to INTERFACE. Each one may be specified multiple times, in which case the commands are executed
                           in order.
              
                     •      SaveConfig — if set to `true', the configuration is saved from the current state of the interface	 upon  shutdown.
                           Any changes made to the configuration file before the interface is removed will therefore be overwritten.
              
                     Recommended  INTERFACE  names  include `wg0' or `wgvpn0' or even `wgmgmtlan0'.  However, the number at the end is in fact
                     optional, and really any free-form string [a-zA-Z0-9_=+.-]{1,15} will work. So even interface names corresponding to geo‐
                     graphic locations would suffice, such as `cincinnati', `nyc', or `paris', if that's somehow desirable.
              
              EXAMPLES
                     These  examples	draw  on the same syntax found for wg(8), and a more complete description may be found there. Bold lines
                     below are for options that extend wg(8).
              
                     The following might be used for connecting as a client to a VPN gateway for tunneling all traffic:
              
                        [Interface]
                        Address = 10.200.100.8/24
                        DNS = 10.200.100.1
                        PrivateKey = oK56DE9Ue9zK76rAc8pBl6opph+1v36lm7cXXsQKrQM=
              
                        [Peer]
                        PublicKey = GtL7fZc/bLnqZldpVofMCD6hDjrK28SsdLxevJ+qtKU=
                        PresharedKey = /UwcSPg38hW/D9Y3tcS1FOV0K1wuURMbS0sesJEP5ak=
                        AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
                        Endpoint = demo.wireguard.com:51820
              
                     The `Address` field is added here in order to set up the address for the interface. The `DNS` field indicates that a  DNS
                     server  for  the interface should be configured via resolvconf(8).  The peer's allowed IPs entry implies that this inter‐
                     face should be configured as the default gateway, which this script does.
              
                     Building on the last example, one might attempt the so-called ``kill-switch'', in order to  prevent  the	 flow  of  unen‐
                     crypted	packets	 through the non-WireGuard interfaces, by adding the following two lines `PostUp` and `PreDown` lines to
                     the `[Interface]` section:
              
                        PostUp = iptables -I OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT
                        PreDown = iptables -D OUTPUT ! -o %i -m mark ! --mark $(wg show %i fwmark) -m addrtype ! --dst-type LOCAL -j REJECT
              
                     The `PostUp' and `PreDown' fields have been added to specify an iptables(8) command which, when used with interfaces that
                     have a peer that specifies 0.0.0.0/0 as part of the `AllowedIPs', works together with wg-quick's fwmark usage in order to
                     drop all packets that are either not coming out of the tunnel encrypted or not going through  the  tunnel  itself.  (Note
                     that  this continues to allow most DHCP traffic through, since most DHCP clients make use of PF_PACKET sockets, which by‐
                     pass Netfilter.) When IPv6 is in use, additional similar lines could be added using ip6tables(8).
              
                     Or, perhaps it is desirable to store private keys in encrypted form, such as through use of pass(1):
              
                        PostUp = wg set %i private-key <(pass WireGuard/private-keys/%i)
              
                     For use on a server, the following is a more complicated example involving multiple peers:
              
                        [Interface]
                        Address = 10.192.122.1/24
                        Address = 10.10.0.1/16
                        SaveConfig = true
                        PrivateKey = yAnz5TF+lXXJte14tji3zlMNq+hd2rYUIgJBgB3fBmk=
                        ListenPort = 51820
              
                        [Peer]
                        PublicKey = xTIBA5rboUvnH4htodjb6e697QjLERt1NAB4mZqp8Dg=
                        AllowedIPs = 10.192.122.3/32, 10.192.124.1/24
              
                        [Peer]
                        PublicKey = TrMvSoP4jYQlY6RIzBgbssQqY3vxI2Pi+y71lOWWXX0=
                        AllowedIPs = 10.192.122.4/32, 192.168.0.0/16
              
                        [Peer]
                        PublicKey = gN65BkIKy1eCE9pP1wdc8ROUtkHLF2PfAqYdyYBz6EA=
                        AllowedIPs = 10.10.10.230/32
              
                     Notice the two `Address' lines at the top, and that `SaveConfig' is set to `true', indicating that the configuration file
                     should be saved on shutdown using the current status of the interface.
              
                     A  combination  of  the	`Table', `PostUp', and `PreDown' fields may be used for policy routing as well. For example, the
                     following may be used to send SSH traffic (TCP port 22) traffic through the tunnel:
              
                        [Interface]
                        Address = 10.192.122.1/24
                        PrivateKey = yAnz5TF+lXXJte14tji3zlMNq+hd2rYUIgJBgB3fBmk=
                        ListenPort = 51820
                        Table = 1234
                        PostUp = ip rule add ipproto tcp dport 22 table 1234
                        PreDown = ip rule delete ipproto tcp dport 22 table 1234
              
                        [Peer]
                        PublicKey = xTIBA5rboUvnH4htodjb6e697QjLERt1NAB4mZqp8Dg=
                        AllowedIPs = 0.0.0.0/0
              
                     These configuration files may be placed in any directory, putting the desired interface name in the filename:
              
                        # wg-quick up /path/to/wgnet0.conf
              
                     For convenience, if only an interface name is supplied, it automatically chooses a path in `/etc/wireguard/':
              
                        # wg-quick up wgnet0
              
                     This will load the configuration file `/etc/wireguard/wgnet0.conf'.
              
                     The strip command is useful for reloading configuration files without disrupting active sessions:
              
                        # wg syncconf wgnet0 <(wg-quick strip wgnet0)
